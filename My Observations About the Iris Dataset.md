My Observations About the Iris Dataset
Dataset Overview:

Number of samples: 150

Number of features: 4

Number of classes: 3

Key Findings from the Visualization:

The setosa species is clearly separated from the other two species based on sepal length and sepal width.

Versicolor and virginica overlap somewhat, making them harder to distinguish using only these two features.

Sepal length generally increases from setosa → versicolor → virginica, suggesting a measurable pattern between species.

Questions for Further Investigation:

Would petal length and petal width provide better separation between versicolor and virginica?

Could a machine learning model accurately classify species using only two features?

Reflection:

In this lab, I learned how to set up and use essential machine learning tools including Jupyter/Colab, VS Code, and core Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. I also practiced loading datasets, exploring data structures, performing basic statistical analysis, and creating visualizations. Additionally, I reinforced my understanding of how GitHub supports version control and project organization in machine learning workflows.
